## Use cases of our audio-rooms (for best experience use earbuds :) 
- Making private study room with classmates 
- Hosting discussion on any classroom topic or educational topics (eg. What is the future of education post-pandemic) privately or publicly where any student can hop-in and participate. 
- Organizing student debates which is moderated by hosts and the winner is chosen by the audience 
- Quizzes 
- Interactive educational podcasts 
- Homework question & answer 
- 1-on-1 or 1-to-many tutoring 
 
## How we built it 
- We got started by building a prototype on Figma. (we were currently working towards building an iOS app) 
- We enlisted all the endpoints. 
- We built the frontend in Swift. We used the Agora API to add the live streaming functionality. 
- We built the backend in Java SpringBoot. We used a SQL database. 
- We documented our API using Postman. (Link here) 
- (regarding deploying) 

## Challenges we ran into 
As a team, we had diverse skillsets and had to work with a tech stack that required us to be innovative with how we collaborated. Creating the database for our REST-API proved difficult in this short period. We were not very familiar with cloud services either, so connecting to Cloud SQL and deployment was challenging.  
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
- We were able to complete the prototype, a fully functional frontend, and a complete backend with databases 
- Despite being in different time zones, we were able to have a smooth collaboration 
 
## What we learned 
We learned many new things as follows: 
-About live-audio streaming APIs. 
-About CockroachDB(though we were not able to use it, we were able to get it working locally) 
-About documenting our API 
-About deploying to the cloud(Google cloud) 
 
## What's next for Converse App 
We plan to release the final version to the AppStore and market it through educational institutions, student clubs, and influencers. Build more room features, to support debates and quizzes and add premium functionality, including an option to record discussions as podcasts. 
It will also be great to improve on the explore section using so that when students open the app it will show the rooms that are perfectly tailored to their interests. And with ML/AI, we can add another feature of suggested rooms according to the studentâ€™s interests and categories it most interacted with.

The future is exciting :)
